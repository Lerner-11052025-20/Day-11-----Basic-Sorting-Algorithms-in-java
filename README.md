# Day-11-----Basic-Sorting-Algorithms-in-java
📅 Day 11 - Basic Sorting Algorithms in Java Welcome to Day 11 of my DSA Fundamentals Series, where I dive into one of the most important topics in computer science — Sorting Algorithms. This repository covers the implementation and explanation of the most commonly used basic sorting techniques using Java.


📖 Theory and Concepts:
Why sorting is important in programming and real-world applications

Time and space complexity analysis

Stability and in-place sorting definitions

🛠️ Sorting Algorithms Implemented:
Bubble Sort
How it works and its inefficiency on large datasets

Selection Sort
Concept of selecting the minimum element

Insertion Sort
Efficient for nearly sorted arrays

Comparison of all three
Performance in best, average, and worst cases

💻 Features of the Code:
Clean, modular Java implementations
Time complexity comments and inline explanations
Step-by-step visualization (in comments or logs)

Sample test arrays and output

📊 Complexity Analysis
| Algorithm      | Best Case | Average Case | Worst Case | Space |
| -------------- | --------- | ------------ | ---------- | ----- |
| Bubble Sort    | O(n)      | O(n²)        | O(n²)      | O(1)  |
| Selection Sort | O(n²)     | O(n²)        | O(n²)      | O(1)  |
| Insertion Sort | O(n)      | O(n²)        | O(n²)      | O(1)  |
